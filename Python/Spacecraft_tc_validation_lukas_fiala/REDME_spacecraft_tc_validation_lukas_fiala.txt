This argument is a repeat of the one provided in the assignment in telecommand TC(20,129).
The task was to emulate how the spacecraft system reacts when it is asked for a device parameter.

## Included

simulate_telecommand.py: Root function in charge of command logic

test_cases.py: Four of these test cases are essential (valid request, invalid device, invalid parameter, device error)

---

## Scope

Validates ranges of Logical Device ID and Parameter ID inputs

Simulates ACK_START behavior and telemetry responses (TM(1,3), TM(20,2), TM(1,4), TM(1,8))

Utilizes simple assertions for testing, with no libraries required
---

## Note

This is a simplified simulation, according to use case flow in section 6.
No actual spacecraft hardware or protocol libraries were used.
If required, it can be expanded further with more sophisticated handling or formatted output.
